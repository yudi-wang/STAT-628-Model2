# BodyFat Project
Yuchen Xu, Mario Ma, Yiteng Tu, Yudi Wang.

## Description
This project focuses on building a predictive model for estimating body fat percentage using various body measurements. The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that covers data preprocessing and model development, along with a Shiny app for interactive body fat predictions. Additionally, the repository includes the original and cleaned data, project summaries, and relevant images used in the analysis.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Code
- **Data Preprocessing and Model Building (Jupyter Notebook)**:
  - The notebook includes both data preprocessing steps (such as handling missing values and outliers) and model building (using machine learning algorithms for prediction).
  
- **Shiny Code**:
  - This code runs the Shiny app that provides an interactive interface for users to input their body measurements and get predicted body fat percentages.

### 2. Data
- **Original Data**: Contains the raw data used for this project.
- **Cleaned Data**: The processed dataset, following data cleaning and feature selection.

### 3. Image
- Contains various images and plots generated during the data analysis and modeling stages.

### 4. Summary
- A document summarizing the key steps in data cleaning, model building, and findings from the project.

### 5. Slides
- Presentation slides summarizing the project, including the datacleaning, methodology, and results.

## Shiny Link
The Shiny app allows users to interactively input measurements and predict body fat percentage based on the trained model. You can access the live app here:
