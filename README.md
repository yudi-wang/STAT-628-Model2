# BodyFat Project
Yuchen Xu, Mario Ma, Yiteng Tu, Yudi Wang.

## Description
This project focuses on building a predictive model for estimating body fat percentage using various body measurements. The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that covers data preprocessing and model development, along with a Shiny app for interactive body fat predictions. Additionally, the repository includes the original and cleaned data, project summaries, and relevant images used in the analysis.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Code
- **Model.ipynb**:
  - The notebook includes both data preprocessing steps (such as handling outliers), model building and model evaluation.
  
- **shiny**:
  - This folder runs the Shiny app that provides an interactive interface for users to input their body measurements and get predicted body fat percentages.
 
- **shiny.zip**:
  - This zip file contains the entire Shiny app directory. You can download it and run the app locally if needed.

### 2. Data
- **BodyFat.csv**: Contains the raw data used for this project.
- **bodyfat_amend.csv**: The processed dataset, following data cleaning.

### 3. Image
- Contains various images and plots generated during the data analysis and modeling stages.

### 4. Summary
- A document summarizing the key steps in data cleaning, model building, and model evaluation from the project.

### 5. Slides
- Presentation slides summarizing the project, including the datacleaning, methodology, and results.

## Shiny Link
The Shiny app allows users to interactively input measurements and predict body fat percentage based on the trained model. You can access the live app here:
